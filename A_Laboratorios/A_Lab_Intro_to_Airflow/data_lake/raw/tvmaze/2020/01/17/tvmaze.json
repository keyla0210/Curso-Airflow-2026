Wanting to save the lives of the people important to him in their last moments, he also aspired to be a doctor. At the hospital, Shouen engages in medical care as an emergency doctor and also chants sutra for the deceased at the morgue or provides psychological care for terminally ill patients as a Buddhist monk. As a result, there are times when he treats patients brought into the emergency centre while he is in his robes and causes them to jump to the conclusion that they have died. Although he is disliked not only by patients but also colleagues for chanting prayers to Buddha and preaching for everything, he is cheerful and sincere. As Shouen grapples with how he should save lives, attend to deaths and support the families of patients, he grows as a doctor, a monk and a person.</p>",
